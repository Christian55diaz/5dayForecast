# 5dayForecast
Hi, this is my 5 day forecast. My website allows you to lookup the weather in any location using the openweather API. Which is a very useful tool. You can use this repo to pull from my html, my css, or even my js files or maybe you pull from the main branch. I am creating this for a school weekly "challenge".

I am not sure what I am doing wrong but for some reason when I go to live pages it brings up my work day schedueler?
